When I run the file I get a message "This app can't run on your PC"
Changing the extension didn't changes the bytesinside the file. 

After setting hello_world.txt to read only, I was able to edit the file but, when I tried to save the changes, the system didnâ€™t allow me to overwrite the original file. Instead, it only allowed me to save it as a new file.
