Current screen resolution: 1920 * 1080
When I change the screen to portrait mode, the display rotates 90 degrees.
I will use this mode for reading long documemts or pages of code.
When i changed the resolution to 800 * 600, everything on the screen became larger, 
and some items didn't fit in the screen.
